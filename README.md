## Simple Cipher Decoder

To run the decoder, pass the text file you want to decode as the command line argument.
For example, >> python decoder.py "encrypted.txt"

Make sure quad_scores.json is in the same directory as decoder.py

The decoder will preserve spacing and returns, but does not keep any punctuation.
